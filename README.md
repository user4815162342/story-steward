Story Steward is an old project of mine, which I'd originally stored on Google Code before that was closed down. I'm currently in the process of switching over to my "stew" project (stew-core, stew-cli repositories) which replaces this project.

This project was downloaded 72 times at its height. I'm assuming that at least a few of those weren't bots or me 
testing the download. So, I'm leaving this code here in case someone actually liked it enough that they're working 
on it themselves.

The project is written using an old version of Dojo, which meant it was a beast to configure, compile and build, 
and it ran in xulrunner, which isn't really well supported anymore, and in firefox using mechanisms which aren't 
allowed anymore without special configuration. These were the primary reasons for abandoning it.

## Make Writing Easier: Don't Organize, Just Create! ##

_Story Steward_ is a tool for organizing and authoring novels and other large writing projects. Use it to keep track of your characters, settings and other notes while organizing your scenes into chapters. Instead of using separate word processor files, spreadsheets, and note cards to keep all these things organized, put it all in one place. Track your word count, and watch how close you're getting to your goals and deadlines. Make it easy to find what you need when you need it. Make backups easier. Don't organize, just create.

With _Story Steward_, *you* own and control the data, it's not out in some stranger's "cloud", and you don't need to be connected in order to work. And, to continue this philosophy, with Story Steward, you don't need to worry about proprietary file formats that can't be read by any other software. The file formats are standard, well-known text-based formats, which means you won't lose access to your data if you can't get Story Steward to run twenty years down the line.

_If you are interested in Story Steward, go ahead and download it, try it out, and [Contact let me know what you think]. Seriously, if I don't hear from you, I'll never know this software is even being used._
