## Contacting Me ##

You should be able to find my e-mail address by clicking on my user name in my profile [here](http://code.google.com/p/story-steward/people/list) and filling out the appropriate captchas.

You can also send me a message through my [web contact form](http://townsedgetechnology.com/contact.html).

Finally, if you have a google account, you can enter a comment on this, or any other documentation page. I should be notified about the comment by e-mail, and I will respond on this same page.

If you don't hear from me by trying one of the ways above, please try another.
